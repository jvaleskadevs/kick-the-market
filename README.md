## Kick the Market game and Jackpot protocol

Imagine the superbowl ad but decentralized and all the spectators in the world can get a portion of the money paid to get announced there. Imagine a global las vegas jackpot for gamers. It is what we built on the Jackpot protocol and the Kick the Market game is just a sample on how to integrate it, and ofc, a meme made real.

### 📉 ORIGINS: FROM MARKET CRASH TO CULT GAME

On October 10, 2025, Trump dropped tariffs on China. The market **crashed**. BTC dumped. ETH bled. Memecoins got nuked. Everyone was salty, scared, and screaming “**WEN BULL RUN?!**”

So we did what any self-respecting crypto degen would do: **we turned trauma into a game.**

We asked: *What if you could literally kick the market back to bullish?*  
Not with prayers. Not with diamond hands. But with **actual kicks**.

So we built it. On **Base chain**. Because [redacted] prints money and we’re not fucking around.

We’re not here to pitch another boring DeFi yield optimizer or some cringe NFT pfp collection that’ll rug in 72 hours. Nah. We’re here to drop a goddamn **cultural nuke** on the current state of onchain gaming — where scoring is meaningless, engagement is dead, and “fun” is a myth buried under gas fees and soulless tokenomics.

Introducing: **Kick the Market & Jackpot** — the first *real* onchain game that doesn’t treat players like data cows. The game that turns market trauma into dopamine. The protocol that makes *minting a score* feel like pulling the lever on a slot machine in a Lambo parked on the moon.

### ⚽ KICK THE MARKET: THE GAME

**Kick the Market** is a hyper-casual, hyper-addictive onchain game where your job is simple: **kick the market up, collect candles, capture data packets, and restore market trust.**

- **Platform**: Desktop, mobile, wallets, **and Farcaster** — yes, you can play in the feed while doomscrolling memes. We’re everywhere you are.
- **Mechanics**: Tap to kick. Each kick increases your score flying. But beware — volatility spikes, manipulation, anomalies, black swans appear, and **shorts try to drag you down.**
- **Scoring**: Your score is your legacy. But legacy without reward is just graffiti. So we built **Jackpot Protocol.**

### 💣 JACKPOT PROTOCOL: THE NUCLEAR REACTOR UNDERNEATH

This is where we flip the script.

Right now, onchain games are broken. You mint a score… and then what? Brag in a Discord? Get a POAP no one cares about?

**Fuck that.**

With **Jackpot Protocol**, every time a player mints a new score in *any* integrated game — they get a **chance to win the global jackpot.**

Yes. **One global jackpot. For all games.**  
And it grows.

#### 🏆 How It Works:
- Every score mint includes a **small entropy fee** ($0.20) — goes into the jackpot pool.
- We use **Pyth fair decentralized entropy SDK** — no manipulation, no bullshit. True randomness, true fairness. 
- **Onchain. Transparent. Unstoppable.**

But here’s the twist: **you can sponsor the jackpot.**

#### 🪙 Sponsorship Tiers — Advertise While You Degens Play:
- **Gold Tier**: 0.01 ETH — 1 available ad spot per week
- **Silver Tier**: 0.0069 ETH — 2 ad spots
- **Bronze Tier**: 0.0042 ETH — 3 ad spots
→ **6 ad slots total per week. First come, first served.**

Sponsors don’t just donate — they **get prime real estate** across *all* games in the Jackpot Protocol. Your ad shows up in the game UI, in leaderboards, in the heat of battle.

This isn’t advertising.  
This is **embedded cultural dominance.**

### 🏁 LEADERBOARDS: FREE TO PLAY, HARD TO WIN

We have two leagues:
1. **Free League**: Mint your score, pay the entropy fee, climb the ranks. Small stakes, big pride.
2. **ETH League**: $1 entry. Weekly tournament. **Winner takes all.** Pure, raw, onchain competition.

No signups. No KYC. Just **wallet connect and go.**

### 🔧 TECH STACK: BUILT TO SCALE, BUILT TO LAST

- **Indexing & Real-Time Data**: **Envio Hyperindex** - because we need real time updates for ads, jackpots, and leaderboards. No lag. No excuses.
- **Hardhat**: Any game can integrate with our **smart contracts** in minutes. Mint a score? Hook into the jackpot. Done.
- **Frontend**: React app built with Vite framework. Available on all platforms. We’re everywhere you are.
- **Backend**: A serverless function for signing score proofs and managing sensitive data like private keys.
- **Pyth entropy SDK** - to generate random numbers for the jackpor. No manipulation, no bullshit. True randomness, true fairness.  
- **Lighthouse Storage** - decentralized immutable storage fits perfectly for our game scores. Your minted scores, untouchable legacy, forever.

### 🚀 WHY THIS MATTERS

We’re fixing three broken things at once:
1. **Onchain gaming is boring** → We made it **addictive**.
2. **Scoring has no stakes** → Now every score could win **thousands**.
3. **Advertising in the crypto ecosystem is spammy, and sometimes, scammy** → Now it’s **native, fair, and valuable**.

This isn’t just a game.  
This is a **movement.**

A movement where players aren’t products.  
Where degens get rewarded for degening.  
Where sponsors pay to be part of the culture — not destroy it.

### 🌍 ROADMAP: FROM HACKATHON TO GLOBAL DOMINANCE (ignore this, it was hallucinated by LLM but I am not removing it to don't jinx that $1M+ XD)

- **Week 1**: Launch Kick the Market on Base, integrate Jackpot.
- **Month 1**: Onboard more games into Jackpot Protocol.
- **Q1 2026**: Launch **Jackpot DAO** — community governs ad pricing, jackpot splits, and game grants.
- **2027**: Jackpot hits **$1M+ weekly pool**. We’re the Twitch of onchain gaming — but you actually **earn** by playing.

### 🎤 FINAL WORD

We didn’t come here to win a hackathon.

We came here to **break the system** that makes onchain games feel like homework.

We turned a market crash into a game.  
We turned scoring into a jackpot.  
We turned ads into assets.

This is **Kick the Market & Jackpot**.

Play it.  
Integrate it.  
Sponsor it.  
**Or get kicked by it.**

GG.
